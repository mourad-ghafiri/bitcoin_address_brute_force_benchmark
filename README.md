## 1. What is a Bitcoin Address?

A Bitcoin address is a unique identifier used to send and receive Bitcoin. It is derived from a **private key** through a series of cryptographic operations. Think of it as your "bank account number" in the Bitcoin network, but with a twist: it is generated in such a way that it is practically impossible to reverse-engineer the private key from the address.

<a name="11-anatomy-of-a-bitcoin-address"></a>
### 1.1 Anatomy of a Bitcoin Address

A Bitcoin address typically looks like this:  
`1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`  

It consists of:  
1. **Version Byte:** Indicates the type of address (e.g., `0x00` for legacy addresses).  
2. **Public Key Hash:** A 160-bit hash derived from the public key.  
3. **Checksum:** Ensures the address is valid and prevents typos.  

<a name="12-how-to-generate-a-bitcoin-address"></a>
### 1.2 How to Generate a Bitcoin Address

The process of generating a Bitcoin address involves several steps, as demonstrated in the code:

```c
// Step 1: Generate a private key using elliptic curve cryptography
EVP_PKEY *key = NULL;
EVP_PKEY_keygen(ctx, &key);

// Step 2: Derive the public key from the private key
unsigned char *pub_key_bytes = NULL;
size_t pub_key_size;
EVP_PKEY_get_octet_string_param(key, OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_PUB_KEY, pub_key_bytes, pub_key_size, NULL);

// Step 3: Hash the public key using SHA-256
unsigned char sha256_result[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
EVP_DigestInit_ex(md_ctx, EVP_sha256(), NULL);
EVP_DigestUpdate(md_ctx, pub_key_bytes, pub_key_size);
EVP_DigestFinal_ex(md_ctx, sha256_result, &sha256_len);

// Step 4: Hash the SHA-256 result using RIPEMD-160
unsigned char ripemd160_result[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
EVP_DigestInit_ex(md_ctx, EVP_ripemd160(), NULL);
EVP_DigestUpdate(md_ctx, sha256_result, sha256_len);
EVP_DigestFinal_ex(md_ctx, ripemd160_result, &ripemd160_len);

// Step 5: Add a version byte (0x00 for legacy addresses)
unsigned char version_ripemd160_result[21];
version_ripemd160_result[0] = 0x00;
memcpy(version_ripemd160_result + 1, ripemd160_result, ripemd160_len);

// Step 6: Compute a checksum using double SHA-256
EVP_DigestInit_ex(md_ctx, EVP_sha256(), NULL);
EVP_DigestUpdate(md_ctx, version_ripemd160_result, 21);
EVP_DigestFinal_ex(md_ctx, sha256_result, &sha256_len);

EVP_DigestInit_ex(md_ctx, EVP_sha256(), NULL);
EVP_DigestUpdate(md_ctx, sha256_result, sha256_len);
EVP_DigestFinal_ex(md_ctx, checksum, &sha256_len);

// Step 7: Combine version, hash, and checksum
unsigned char binary_address[25];
memcpy(binary_address, version_ripemd160_result, 21);
memcpy(binary_address + 21, checksum, 4);

// Step 8: Encode the result in Base58
base58_encode(binary_address, 25, address);
Key Steps Explained:

Private Key Generation: A random 256-bit number is generated using elliptic curve cryptography.

Public Key Derivation: The public key is derived from the private key using the secp256k1 curve.

Hashing: The public key is hashed using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 to create a 160-bit hash.

Checksum Calculation: A checksum is computed using double SHA-256 to ensure address integrity.

Base58 Encoding: The final address is encoded in Base58 to make it human-readable.

2. The Brute-Force Experiment
<a name="21-code-architecture"></a>

2.1 Code Architecture
The multi-process/multi-threaded design maximizes CPU utilization:

c
Copy
// Process spawning in main()
for (int i = 0; i < num_processes - 1; i++) {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        run_benchmark(num_threads, duration, i + 1);
        exit(0);
    }
}

// Thread function structure
void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    while (should_continue) {
        generate_single_address(ctx, md_ctx, address);
        // Shared memory updates
        pthread_mutex_lock(&shared_mem->mutex);
        shared_mem->total_addresses++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&shared_mem->mutex);
    }
}
Key Features:

12 processes × 8 threads = 96 concurrent workers

Shared memory synchronization via shm_open() and mutexes

OpenSSL-optimized cryptographic operations

<a name="22-key-technical-components"></a>

2.2 Key Technical Components
1. Elliptic Curve Mathematics

c
Copy
EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_EC, NULL);
EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_ec_paramgen_curve_nid(ctx, NID_secp256k1);
Uses Bitcoin's secp256k1 curve

Each key generation involves modular arithmetic on a 256-bit prime field

2. Hashing Pipeline

c
Copy
EVP_Digest(..., EVP_sha256()); // SHA-256
EVP_Digest(..., EVP_ripemd160()); // RIPEMD-160
Combines SHA-256's collision resistance with RIPEMD-160's compactness

3. Base58 Encoding

c
Copy
base58_encode(binary_address, 25, address);
Avoids ambiguous characters (0/O, I/l)

Includes 4-byte checksum to detect errors

Actual Attack Vectors vs Brute-Force

c
Copy
// Real security concerns (not addressed in code)
if (private_key_leaked) {
    steal_funds(); // 100% success rate
}
Risk Factor	Probability	Mitigation
Private Key Leak	High	Hardware wallets, air-gapping
Address Reuse	Medium	Use new addresses per tx
Brute-Force	6.84×10⁻³⁹	Mathematically impossible
Recommended Practices:

Use hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets

Enable multi-signature security

Keep software updated (e.g., Taproot adoption)

Monitor quantum computing developments

Conclusion: The Unbreakable Vault
The experiment demonstrates three fundamental truths:

Mathematical Certainty
Bitcoin's 160-bit address space creates combinatorial explosion beyond physical limits

Energy Infeasibility
Brute-force energy costs exceed all known energy resources in the universe

Temporal Impossibility
Required time exceeds the universe's lifespan by 26 orders of magnitude

While no system is perfectly secure, Bitcoin's address generation mechanism represents one of the most cryptographically secure systems ever created. The real security challenge lies not in breaking the mathematics, but in protecting private keys from human error – a testament to Bitcoin's elegant design philosophy.
